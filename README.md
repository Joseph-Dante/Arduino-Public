**Description:** These are Arduino Projects open to the public for you to use.

**Notes:** When adding a MP3 files to audio projects, you have to delete everything on the SD Card first and then copy everything from the source folder. File Date affects the play order, not file name, eventhough the file nmes need to be 001.mp3, oo2.mp3, etc.

I have added Sketches, Fritzing Diagrams and Parts Lists for each project.

**Sketches are as follows:**

**May 27, 2023**
1. mp3_ambient_player.ino - loads and plays the MP3 file when the Arduino is turned on. This is great for general background ambiance for a room or session. 
2. mp3_ambient_player_with_trigger.ino - loads and plays when the IO Sensor is triggered. This is great for industrial ambiance when you only want it to play when someone is close by.
I have also added a DF Player Mini Pin-out image and a parts list for both projects.
